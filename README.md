Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a rising primary liver malignancy in the world with a limited curative option. It is caused by different aetiologies e.g. Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). A systematic understanding of how NAFLD contributes to HCC is still lacking. Autophagy has been considered to have diagnostic and prognostic relevance in NAFLD progression to HCC. My analysis aimed to assess autophagyâ€™s diagnostic and prognostic role in HCC by using its poor activity biomarker, Sequestosome 1 (p62) which a comparison of the results revealed that the cytoplasmic p62-percentage was higher in NAFLD-induced HCC which can be referred as poorer autophagy activity seems to be common in NAFLD patients.
